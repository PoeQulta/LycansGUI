# LycansGUI
GUI and Ground-side prototype system written in C++ on the QT framework

Things that it Does:
* Sends and receives data through serial port (tested with arduino, but should work on rfd900x)
* Graphs incoming data on a splinechart graph
* Creates a csv file data log (similar to excel) and records in it the time against recieved data
* records and indicates with a vertical line when *payload* or *CDA* buttons have been pressed (added to code after demo video was recorded, but shown in the screen grabs)
