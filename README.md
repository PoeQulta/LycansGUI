# LycansGUI
GUI and Ground-side prototype system written in C++ on the QT framework

Things that it Does:
* Sends and receives data through serial port (tested with arduino, but should work on rfd900x)
* Graphs incoming data on a splinechart graph
* Creates a csv file data log (similar to excel) and records in it the time against recieved data
